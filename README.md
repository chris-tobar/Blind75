 Practice algorithm and data structure problems to test knowledge and speed of solving the problem

 Each problem that is being solved is timed, depending on its difficulty.
 Easy = 25 Minutes
 Medium = 35 Minutes
 Hard = 45 Minutes

 Solutions that were created either under the time limit, or as time limit gets hit will be pushed,
 along with comments explaining flow and thought process of the code.

 If the solution pushed isn't the fastest or isn't correct, another push with the correct solution with 
 comments explaining it will be pushed.s
